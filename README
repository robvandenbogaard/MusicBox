==== MusicBox ====

Emulates a (hand-cranked) music box to be able to review punch card compositions
before actually punching paper.

=== Installation ===

* have TiMidity installed (not needed if you want to connect to a different midi device anyway)
* gem install midiator

=== Usage ===

* edit test.music or create a new file
* if created a new file, edit musicbox and change the filename test.music to match the new one
* execute ruby musicbox.rb

MusicBox tries to connect the midi outs and ins to TiMidity as a convenience service (using aconnect).
If this fails it falls back to a prompt requiring manual console action.
